#### **Ansible**
* "Ansible is an open source community project sponsored by Red Hat, it's the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible is the only automation language that can be used across entire IT teams from systems and network administrators to developers and managers."[^1]..."Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs."[^2]

#### **Ansible Playbook**
* "An Ansible® playbook is a blueprint of automation tasks—which are complex IT actions executed with limited or no human involvement. Ansible playbooks are executed on a set, group, or classification of hosts, which together make up an Ansible inventory.
* Ansible playbooks are essentially frameworks, which are prewritten code developers can use ad-hoc or as starting template. Ansible playbooks are regularly used to automate IT infrastructure (such as operating systems and Kubernetes platforms), networks, security systems, and developer personas (such as Git and Red Hat CodeReady Studio).
* Ansible playbooks help IT staff program applications, services, server nodes, or other devices without the manual overhead of creating everything from scratch. And Ansible playbooks—as well as the conditions, variables, and tasks within them—can be saved, shared, or reused indefinitely."[^3]
* For more information, see the [Ansible Service Catlog Entry](https://confluence.biola.edu/display/ithd/Ansible+-+Service+Catalog+Entry).

#### **Ansible Requirements File**
* "You can set up a requirements.yml file to install multiple collections in one command. This file is a YAML file...To install both roles and collections at the same time with one command, run the following: ```ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml```[^4]
* For more information, see the [Ansible Service Catlog Entry](https://confluence.biola.edu/display/ithd/Ansible+-+Service+Catalog+Entry).

#### **Ansible Roles**
* "Ansible roles allow you to develop reusable automation components by grouping and encapsulating related automation artifacts, like configuration files, templates, tasks, and handlers. Because roles isolate these components, it's easier to reuse them and share them with other people. You can also make your roles configurable by exposing variables that users can set when calling the role, allowing them to configure their system according to specific requirements."[^5]
* For more information, see the [Ansible Service Catlog Entry](https://confluence.biola.edu/display/ithd/Ansible+-+Service+Catalog+Entry).
