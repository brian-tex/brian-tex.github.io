# Introduction

- Container Image: 
  - "A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers â€“ images become containers when they run on Docker Engine."1
